/**
 * An HTTP provider adapter.
 *
 * This is the adapter shape a real provider would use, exercised against the local synthetic service so
 * the transport boundary is tested without contacting anyone. `MockProvider` returns values; this one
 * opens a socket, so it is the only place where a reset connection, a truncated body, a 429 with
 * `Retry-After` or an oversized response can actually be observed.
 *
 * FOUR DECISIONS carry the weight, and each one is a place a naive adapter quietly does the wrong thing:
 *
 *   1. EVERY FAILURE IS CLASSIFIED, never passed through raw. The gateway decides whether to retry and
 *      whether fallback is AUTHORIZED from the failure class (B-4-2), so an unclassified error would
 *      default to the most expensive interpretation. A 429 and a 503 are retryable; a 400 or a 401 are
 *      not, because re-sending the same bytes to a second paid model cannot fix them.
 *   2. CANCELLATION IS PROPAGATED AND THEN TOLD APART FROM A FAILURE. An abort raises a
 *      `CancellationError`, not a transport failure — the classifier's transport pattern matches the word
 *      "aborted", so treating an abort as retryable would turn one cancellation into N paid attempts
 *      (ADR-0049).
 *   3. THE BODY IS BOUNDED. A response is read with a byte ceiling and the socket is destroyed when it is
 *      exceeded, so a misbehaving or hostile endpoint cannot exhaust memory.
 *   4. MISSING USAGE STAYS MISSING. A provider that reports no usage yields `undefined`, never zeros, so
 *      the accounting layer can record "unknown" rather than a false zero.
 *
 * The endpoint is configuration, and it is validated: only http/https, and by default only loopback, so a
 * misconfigured or attacker-supplied endpoint cannot be used to reach internal services (SSRF).
